SymbioticLab focuses on *large-scale data systems* that can yield order-of-magnitude performance and efficiency improvements.
We tailor existing Big Data and AI/ML applications and design new ones to best leverage their underlying infrastructure.
This boils down to three operating regimes: single-microsecond latency *within a rack*, single-millisecond latency *within a datacenter*, and hundreds-of-milliseconds latency *across the world*.
